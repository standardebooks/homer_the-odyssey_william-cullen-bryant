			<p>
				<span>They came to Lacedaemon’s valley, seamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With dells, and to the palace of its king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glorious Menelaus, whom they found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within, and at a wedding banquet, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both for his blameless daughter and his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many guests. Her he must send away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride of the son of that invincible chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Achilles. He betrothed her while in Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave his kingly word, and now the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfilled it by the marriage. He was now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sending her forth, with steeds and cars, to reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble city of the Myrmidons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where ruled her consort. From the Spartan coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He brought Alector’s daughter for his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gallant Megapenthes, borne to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a handmaiden in his later years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For not to Helen had the gods vouchsafed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet other offspring, after she had brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lovely daughter forth, Hermione,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like golden Venus both in face and form.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So banqueting the neighbors and the friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glorious Menelaus sat beneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lofty ceiling of those spacious halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delighted with the feast. A sacred bard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amidst them touched the harp and sang to them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, as the song began, two dancers sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the midst and trod the measure there</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But they⁠—the hero-youth Telemachus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Nestor’s eminent son⁠—were at the gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And standing in the entrance with their steeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worthy Eteoneus, coming forth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trusty servant of the glorious son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Atreus⁠—saw, and hastening thence to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shepherd of the people, through the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He came to him, and spake these winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Menelaus, foster-child of Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two strangers have arrived, two men who seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended from almighty Jupiter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall we then loose the harness from their steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or bid them elsewhere seek a friendly host?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fair-haired king indignantly replied:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, Eteoneus, thou hast not been wont.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of Boëthus, thus to play the fool.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou pratest idly, like a child. Ourselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have sat, as guests, at generous banquets given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By other men, when journeying hitherward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hope that Jove might grant a respite here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From our disasters. Hasten, then, to loose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The steeds, and bring the strangers to the feast.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the attendant hastened forth and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other trusty servitors, with charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow. They unyoked the sweaty steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound them to the stalls, and gave them oats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which they mingled the white barley-grains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close against the shining wall they placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The car, and then they led the guests within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sumptuous palace. Entering, these admired</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of the foster-child of Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For like the splendor of the sun and moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its glory was. They with delighted eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazed, and, descending to the polished baths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bathed. The attendant maids who at the bath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had ministered, anointing them with oil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrayed the stranger guests in fleecy cloaks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tunics. Each sat down upon a throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near to Atrides. Now a handmaid brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A beautiful ewer of gold, and laver wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of silver, and poured water for their hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spread a polished table near their seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The reverend matron of the household came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bread, and set before them many a dish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered from all the feast. The carver next</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought chargers lifted high, and in them meats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of every flavor, and before them placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beakers of gold. The fair-haired monarch gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hand to each, and then bespake them thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now taste our banquet and rejoice, and when</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye are refreshed with food we will inquire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ye may be; for ye are not of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose race degenerates, ye are surely born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sceptred kings, the favorites of Jove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ignoble men have never sons like you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus having said, and taking in his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fatling bullock’s chine, which menials brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roasted, and placed beside the king in sign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of honor, this he laid before his guests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they put forth their hands and banqueted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the calls of hunger and of thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At length were stilled, Telemachus inclined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His head toward Nestor’s son, that no one else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might listen to his words, and thus he said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See, son of Nestor, my beloved friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all these echoing rooms the sheen of brass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gold, of amber, and of ivory;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is the palace of Olympian Jove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within its walls. How many things are here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of priceless worth! I wonder as I gaze.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fair-haired Menelaus heard him speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus accosted both with winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear sons, no mortal man may vie with Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose palace and possessions never know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decay, but other men may vie or not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In wealth with me. ’Twas after suffering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wandering long that in my fleet I brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wealth with me, and landed on this coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the eighth year. For I had roamed afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Cyprus and to Phoenicè, and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Egyptians dwell, and Ethiopia’s sons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Sidonians, and the Erembian race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the coast of Lybia, where the lambs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are yeaned with budding horns. There do the ewes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice in the circle of the year bring forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their young. There both the master of the herd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And herdsman know no lack of cheese, or flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or of sweet milk; for there the herds yield milk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole year round. While I was roaming thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gathering store of wealth, another slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brother, unforewarned, and through the fraud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his own guilty consort. Therefore small</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the content I find in bearing rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er these possessions. Ye have doubtless heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This from your parents, be they who they may;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For much have I endured, and I have lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A palace, a most noble dwelling-place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of things rare and precious. Even now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would I possessed within my palace here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the third part of these; and would that they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were yet alive who perished on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Troy afar from Argos and its steeds!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet while I grieve and while I mourn them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, sitting in my palace, I by turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indulge my heart in weeping, and by turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pause, for with continual sorrow comes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A weariness of spirit. Yet, in truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For none of all those warriors, though their fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afflicts me sorely, do I so much grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As for one hero. When I think of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feast and couch are joyless, since, of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Achaian chiefs, none brought so much to pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As did Ulysses, both in what he wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what he suffered. Great calamities</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to his lot in life, and to my own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grief for his sake that cannot be consoled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long has he been divided from his friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whether he be living now or dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know not. Old Laertes, the sage queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Penelope, and young Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom, when he went to war he left newborn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At home, are sorrowing somewhere for his sake.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and woke anew the young man’s grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his lost father. From his eyelids fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears at the hearing of his father’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with both hands he held before his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The purple mantle. Menelaus saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tears, and pondered, doubting which were best⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To let the stranger of his own accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak of his father, or to question him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At first, and then to tell him all he knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As thus he pondered, Helen, like in form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Dian of the golden distaff, left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her high-roofed chamber, where the air was sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With perfumes, and approached. Adrasta placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seat for her of costly workmanship;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alcippè brought a mat of soft light wool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Phylo with a silver basket came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Given by Alcandra, wife of Polybus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dwelt at Thebes, in Egypt, and whose house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was rich in things of price. Two silver baths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave to Menelaus, tripods two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And talents ten of gold. His wife bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful gifts on Helen⁠—one of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A distaff; one a silver basket edged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With gold and round in form. This Phylo brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaped with spun yarn and placed before the queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon it lay the distaff, wrapped in wool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of color like the violet. Helen there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat down, a footstool at her feet, and straight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Questioned with earnest words her husband thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Say, Menelaus, foster-child of Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it yet known what lineage these men claim⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These visitants? And what I now shall say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will it be false or true? Yet must I speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woman or man I think I never saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like another as this youth, on whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I look with deep astonishment, is like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus, the son whom our great chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses left at home a tender babe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When ye Achaians for my guilty sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went forth to wage the bloody war with Troy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And fair-haired Menelaus answered her:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, wife, so deem I as it seems to thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such are his feet, his hands, the cast of the eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His head, the hair upon his brow. Just now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In speaking of Ulysses, as I told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How he had toiled and suffered for my sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stranger held the purple cloak before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes, and from the lids dropped bitter tears.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Peisistratus, the son of Nestor, spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In answer: “Menelaus, foster-child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Jove and son of Atreus! sovereign king!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is, as thou hast said, that hero’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he is modest, and he deems that ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It would become him, on arriving here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he should venture in discourse while thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art present, in whose voice we take delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were the utterance of a god.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knight Gerenian Nestor sent me forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To guide him hither⁠—for he earnestly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desired to see thee, that thou mightest give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Counsel in what he yet should say or do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For bitterly a son, who finds at home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No others to befriend him, must lament</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The absence of a father. So it is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With young Telemachus; for far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father is, and in the land are none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have the power to shelter him from wrong.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fair-haired Menelaus answered thus:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O wonder! Then the son of one most dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who for my sake so oft has braved and borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The conflicts of the battlefield, hath come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath my roof. I thought that I should greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father with a warmer welcome here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any other of the Argive race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Jove the Olympian Thunderer should grant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A safe return to us across the deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our good ships. I would have founded here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For him a city in Argos, and have built</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwellings, and would have brought from Ithaca</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him and his son, and all his wealth and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His people. To this end I would have caused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some neighboring district where my sway is owned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be dispeopled. Dwelling here we oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should then have met each other, and no cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would e’er have parted us, two faithful friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delighting in each other, till at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came Death’s black cloud to wrap us in its shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A god, no doubt, hath seen in this a good</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too great for us, and thus to him alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unhappy man! denied a safe return.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; his words awoke in every heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grief for the absent hero’s sake. Then wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Argive Helen, child of Jove; then wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus; nor tearless were the eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Nestor’s son, for to his mind arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The memory of the good Antilochus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slain by the bright Aurora’s eminent son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him he thought, and spake these winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O son of Atreus! aged Nestor saith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in his palace we discourse of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask each other’s thought, that thou art wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all other men. Now, if thou mayst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indulge me, for not willingly I weep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus at the evening feast, and soon will Morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Child of the Dawn, appear. I do not blame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sorrow for whoever meets his fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dies; the only honors we can pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those unhappy mortals is to shred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our locks away, and wet our cheeks with tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lost a brother, not the least in worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the Argives, whom thou must have seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I knew him not: I never saw his face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet is it said Antilochus excelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The others; swift of foot, and brave in war.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fair-haired Menelaus answered him:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since thou my friend hast spoken thus, as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Discreet in word and deed, of riper years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than thou, might speak and act⁠—for thou art born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such a father, and thy words are wise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And easy is it to discern the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one on whom Saturnius has bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both at the birth-hour and in wedded life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His blessing; as he gives to Nestor now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A calm old age that lapses pleasantly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his palace-halls, from day to day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sons wise-minded, mighty with the spear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then let us lay aside this sudden grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That has o’ertaken us, and only think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of banqueting. Let water now be poured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon our hands; there will be time enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tomorrow for discourse; Telemachus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will then engage in mutual talk.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, Asphalion, who with diligent heed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Served the great Menelaus, on their hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poured water, and they shared the meats that lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the board. But Helen, Jove-born dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had other thoughts, and with the wine they drank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingled a drug, an antidote to grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And anger, bringing quick forgetfulness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all life’s evils. Whoso drinks, when once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is infused and in the cup, that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall never wet his cheeks with tears, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father and his mother lie in death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor though his brother or beloved son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall butchered by the sword before his eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such sovereign drugs she had, that child of Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Given her by Polydamna, wife of Thon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dame of Egypt, where the bounteous soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings forth abundantly its potent herbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of healing some and some of bane, and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwell the physicians who excel in skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All other men, for they are of the race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Paeon. Now when Helen in the cups</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had placed the drug, and bidden them to pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wine upon it, thus she spake again:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ye the sons of heroes!⁠—Jupiter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sovereign, gives, at pleasure, good and ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one or to another, for his power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is infinite⁠—now sitting in these halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feast and enjoy free converse. I will speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What suits the occasion. I could not relate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I could not even name, the many toils</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne by Ulysses, stout of heart. I speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only of what that valiant warrior did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And suffered once in Troy, where ye of Greece</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endured such hardships. He had given himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unseemly stripes, and o’er his shoulders flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vile garments like a slave’s, and entered thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The enemy’s town, and walked its spacious streets.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another man he seemed in that disguise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A beggar, though when at the Achaian fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So different was the semblance that he wore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He entered Ilium thus transformed, and none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew who it was that passed, but I perceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And questioned him; he turned my quest aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With crafty answers. After I had seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bath administered, anointed him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clothed him, and had sworn a solemn oath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to reveal his visit to the men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Ilium till he reached again the tents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And galleys, then he opened to me all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The plans of the Achaians. Leaving me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his return he slew with his long spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a Trojan, and in safety reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Argive camp with tidings for the host.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then wept aloud the Trojan dames, but I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was glad at heart, for I already longed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my old home, and deeply I deplored</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The evil fate that Venus brought on me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who led me thither from my own dear land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from my daughter and my marriage-bower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from my lawful spouse, in whom I missed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No noble gift of person or of mind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fair-haired Menelaus said to her:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All thou hast spoken, woman, is most true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many a valiant warrior I have known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The counsels and the purposes, and far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have roamed in many lands, but never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My eyes have looked on such another man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As was Ulysses, of a heart so bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such endurance. Witness what he did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore, the heroic man, what time we sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bravest of the Argives, pent within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wooden horse, about to bring to Troy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaughter and death. Thou earnest to the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved, as it seemed, by some divinity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who thought to give the glory of the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Troy. Deiphobus, the godlike chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was with thee. Thrice about the hollow frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That held the ambush thou didst walk and touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its sides, and call the Achaian chiefs by name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And imitate the voices of the wives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the Argives. Diomed and I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat with the great Ulysses in the midst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with him heard thy call, and rose at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sally forth or answer from within;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he forbade, impatient as we were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so restrained us. All the Achaian chiefs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept silence save Anticlus, who alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to speak, when, with his powerful hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses pressed together instantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The opening lips, and saved us all, and thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held them till Pallas lured thee from the spot.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake discreet Telemachus again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruler of tribes! the harder was his lot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since even thus he could not shun the stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of death, not though a heart of steel were his.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now dismiss us to our beds, that there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couched softly, we may welcome balmy sleep.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and Argive Helen called her maids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make up couches in the portico,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And throw fair purple blankets over them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tapestry above, and cover all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shaggy cloaks. Forth from the palace halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They went with torches, and made ready soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The couches; thither heralds led the guests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the vestibule Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero, and with him the eminent son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Nestor, took their rest. Meanwhile the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Atreus lay within an inner room</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that magnificent pile, and near to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glorious lady, long-robed Helen, slept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when at length the daughter of the Dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rosy-fingered Morning, brought her light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Menelaus, great in battle, rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put on his garments, took his trenchant sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, having hung it on his shoulder, laced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shapely sandals to his shining feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And issued from his chamber like a god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In aspect. Near Telemachus he took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His seat, and calling him by name he spake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What urgent cause, my brave Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings thee to sacred Lacedaemon o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breast of the great ocean? Frankly say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it a private or a public need?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus discreet Telemachus replied:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruler of nations! I am come to ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>News of my father, if thou knowest aught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My heritage is wasting; my rich fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are made a desolation. Enemies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swarm in my palace, and from day to day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaughter my flocks and slow-paced horned herds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother’s suitors they, and measureless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their insolence. And therefore am I come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To clasp thy knees, and pray thee to relate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The manner of my father’s sorrowful death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou hast seen it with thine eyes, or heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its story from some wandering man⁠—for sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mother brought him forth to wretchedness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the common lot. I ask thee not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To soften aught in the sad history</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through tenderness to me, or kind regard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But tell me plainly all that thou dost know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I beseech thee, if at any time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, good Ulysses, brought to pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aught that he undertook for thee in word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or act while ye were in the realm of Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Greeks suffered sorely, bear it now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mind, and let me have the naked truth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Menelaus of the amber locks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew a deep sigh, and thus in answer said:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Heavens! they would climb into a brave man’s bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These craven weaklings. But as when a hart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has hid her newborn suckling fawns within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lair of some fierce lion, and gone forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herself to range the mountainsides and feed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the grassy lawns, the lion comes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the place and brings them sudden death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So will Ulysses bring a bloody fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the suitor crew. O father Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Pallas, and Apollo! I could wish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That now, with prowess such as once was his</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he, of yore, in Lesbos nobly built,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising to strive with Philomela’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In wrestling threw him heavily, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Greeks rejoiced, Ulysses might engage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors. Short were then their term of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitter would the nuptial banquet be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now for the questions thou hast put, and craved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From me a true reply, I will not seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pass them by with talk of other things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet deceive thee, but of all that once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was told me by the Ancient of the Deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose words are truth, I shall keep nothing back.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In Egypt still, though longing to come home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gods detained me; for I had not paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sacrifice of chosen hecatombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever do the gods require of us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembrance of their laws. There is an isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the billowy sea before you reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coast of Egypt⁠—Pharos is its name⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At such a distance as a ship could pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In one whole day with a shrill breeze astern.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sheltered haven lies within that isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence the good ships go forth with fresh supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of water. There the gods constrained my stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For twenty days, and never in that time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blew favoring winds across the waters, such</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As bear the galley over the great deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now would our stores of food have been consumed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now would the courage of my men have died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not a goddess pitied me, and come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my relief, by name Idothea, born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great Proteus, Ancient of the Deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she was moved by my distress, and came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me while I was wandering alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart from all the rest. They through the isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roamed everywhere from place to place, and, pinched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunger, threw the hook for fish. She came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, standing near, accosted me and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Stranger, thou art an idiot, or at least</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of careless mood, or else art willingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neglectful, and art pleased with suffering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou dost linger in this isle so long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find no means to leave it, while the hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy companions faint with the delay.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She spake, and I replied: ‘Whoe’er thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>goddess, let me say, not willingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I linger here. I surely must have sinned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the immortal dwellers of high heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But tell me⁠—for the gods know all things⁠—who</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the immortals holds me windbound here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hindering my voyage; tell me also how</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reach my home across the fishy deep.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I ended, and the glorious goddess said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In answer: ‘Stranger, I will truly speak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deathless Ancient of the Deep, whose words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are ever true, Egyptian Proteus, oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here makes his haunt. To him are fully known⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he is Neptune’s subject⁠—all the depths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great ocean. It is said I owe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him my birth. If him thou canst insnare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seize, he will disclose to thee thy way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all its distances, and tell thee how</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reach thy home across the fishy deep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And further will reveal, if so he choose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O foster-child of Jove, whate’er of good</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ill has in thy palace come to pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While thou wert wandering long and wearily.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So said the goddess, and I spake again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Explain by what device to snare and hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged deity, lest he foreknow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else suspect our purpose and escape.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twere hard for mortals to constrain a god.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I ended, and the glorious goddess thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer: ‘When the climbing sun has reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The middle heaven, the Ancient of the Deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ne’er deceives, emerges from the waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, covered with the dark scum of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks forth, and in a cavern vault lies down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither fair Halosydna’s progeny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-calves from the hoary ocean, throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rank with the bitter odor of the brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slumber near him. With the break of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will conduct thee thither and appoint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy place, but thou shalt choose to go with thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three of the bravest men in thy good ships.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let me now relate the stratagems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the old prophet. He at first will count</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-calves, going o’er them all by fives;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he has beheld and numbered all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amidst them all will he lie down, as lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shepherd midst his flock. And then, as soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As ye behold him stretched at length, exert</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your utmost strength to hold him there, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He strive and struggle to escape your hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he will try all stratagems, and take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The form of every reptile on the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn to water and to raging flame⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet hold him firmly still, and all the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make fast the bands. When he again shall take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The form in which thou sawest him asleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desist from force, and loose the bands that held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ancient prophet. Ask of him what god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afflicts thee thus, and by what means to cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fishy deep and find thy home again.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus having said, the goddess straightway sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the billowy ocean, while I sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The galleys, where they rested on the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With an uneasy spirit. When I reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ship and shore we made our evening meal.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hallowed night came down; we lay and slept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the sea-beach. When the Morning came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth on the border of the mighty main</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I went, and prayed the immortals fervently.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I led three comrades, whom I trusted most</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all adventures. Entering the depths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great sea, the goddess brought us thence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Four skins of sea-calves newly flayed, that thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We might deceive her father. Then she scooped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beds for us in the sea-sand, and sat down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wait his coming. We were near to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there she laid us duly down, and threw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A skin o’er each. Now did our ambush seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond endurance, for the noisome smell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those sea-nourished creatures sickened us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who could bear to sleep beside a whale?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she bethought her of an antidote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sovereign one, and so relieved us all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To each she brought ambrosia, placing it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath his nostrils, and the sweets it breathed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ercame the animal odor. All the morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We waited patiently. The sea-calves came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From ocean in a throng, and laid themselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rows along the margin of the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At noon emerged the aged seer, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His well-fed sea-calves. Going o’er them all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He counted them, ourselves among the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With no misgiving of the fraud, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laid him down to rest. We rushed with shouts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon him suddenly, and in our arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught him; nor did the aged seer forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His stratagems; and first he took the shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a maned lion, of a serpent next,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then of a panther, then of a huge boar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turned to flowing water, then became</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tall tree full of leaves. With resolute hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We held him fast, until the aged seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wearied out, in spite of all his wiles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And questioned me in speech at last and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O son of Atreus! who of all the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath taught thee how to take me in this snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwilling as I am? What wouldst thou have?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake; I answered: ‘Aged prophet, well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest. Why deceitfully inquire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is that I am held a prisoner long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within this isle, and vainly seek the means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my escape, and grief consumes my heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now⁠—since the gods know all things⁠—tell me this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What deity it is, that, hindering thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My voyage, keeps me here, and tell me how</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cross the fishy deep and reach my home.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Such were my words, and he in answer said:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘But thou to Jove and to the other gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst first have paid acceptable sacrifice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouldst have then embarked to reach with speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy native land across the dark-blue deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now it is not thy fate to see again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy friends, thy stately palace, and the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saw thy birth, until thou stand once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the river that through Egypt flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Jove, and offer sacred hecatombs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the ever-living gods inhabiting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boundless heaven, and they will speed thee forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the voyage thou dost long to make.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake. My heart was broken as I heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His bidding to recross the shadowy sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Egypt, for the way was difficult</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long; and yet I answered him and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Duly will I perform, O aged seer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thou commandest. But I pray thee tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truly, whether all the sons of Greece</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Nestor and myself, in setting sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left on the Trojan coast, have since returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe with their galleys, or have any died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untimely in their ships or in the arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their companions since the war was closed?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I spake; again he answered me and said:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Why dost thou ask, Atrides, since to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou needest not, nor is it well to explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The secrets of my mind? Thou canst not, sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Refrain from tears when thou shalt know the whole.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many are dead, and many left in Troy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two leaders only of the well-armed Greeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were slain returning; in that combat thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst bear a part; one, living yet, is kept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the mighty main, from his return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Amid his well-oared galleys Ajax died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Neptune first had driven him on the rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Gyrae, yet had saved him from the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, though Pallas hated him, had yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Been rescued, but for uttering boastful words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which drew his fate upon him. He had said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he, in spite of all the gods, would come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe from those mountain waves. When Neptune heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boaster’s challenge, instantly he laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His strong hand on the trident, smote the rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cleft it to the base. Part stood erect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Part fell into the deep. There Ajax sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt the shock, and with the falling mass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was carried headlong to the billowy depths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Below, and drank the brine and perished there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy brother in his roomy ships escaped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The danger, for imperial Juno’s aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Preserved him. But when near Meleia’s heights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About to land, a tempest seized and swept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero thence across the fishy deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lamenting his hard lot, to that far cape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where once abode Thyestes, and where now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His son Aegisthus dwelt. But when the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent other winds, and safe at last appeared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voyage, they returned, and reached their home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With joy he stepped upon his native soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed the earth that bore him, while his tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At that most welcome sight flowed fast and warm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him from a lofty perch a spy beheld,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom treacherous Aegisthus planted there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bribed by two golden talents. He had watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole year through, lest, coming unobserved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king might make his prowess felt. The spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew to the royal palace with the news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And instantly Aegisthus planned a snare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He chose among the people twenty men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bravest, whom he stationed out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave command that others should prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A banquet. Then with chariots and with steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a deadly purpose in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He went, and, meeting Agamemnon, bade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shepherd of the people to the feast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slew him at the board as men might slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bullock at the crib. Of all who went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Agamemnon thither, none survived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the followers of Aegisthus none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all were slaughtered in the banquet-hall’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake; my heart was breaking, and I wept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While sitting on the sand, nor in my heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cared I to live, or longer to behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweet light of the sun. But when there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respite from tears and writhing on the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Ancient of the Deep, who ne’er deceives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake yet again: ‘Atrides, lose no time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In tears; they profit nothing. Rather seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The means by which thou mayst the soonest reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy native land. There thou perchance mayst find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aegisthus yet alive, or haply first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Orestes may have slain him, and thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrive to see the funeral rites performed.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake, and though afflicted still, my heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was somewhat comforted; my spirit rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus I answered him with winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘These men I know; name now the third, who still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is kept from his return afar within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty main⁠—alive, perchance, or dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, though I dread to hear, I long to know.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I spake, and Proteus answered me again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘It is Laertes’ son, whose dwelling stands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ithaca. I saw him in an isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the cavern-palace of the nymph</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calypso, weeping bitterly, for she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Constrains his stay. He cannot leave the isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his own country; ship arrayed with oars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seamen has he none to bear him o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breast of the great ocean. But for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis not decreed that thou shalt meet thy fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And die, most noble Menelaus, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The steeds of Argos in her pastures graze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gods will send thee to the Elysian plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the end of earth, the dwelling-place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fair-haired Rhadamanthus. There do men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead easiest lives. No snow, no bitter cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No beating rains, are there; the ocean-deeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With murmuring breezes from the West refresh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dwellers. Thither shalt thou go; for thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art Helen’s spouse, and son-in-law of Jove.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake, and plunged into the billowy deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I to the fleet returned in company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my brave men, revolving, as I went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand projects in my thought. I reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My galley by the sea, and we prepared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our evening meal. The hallowed night came down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there upon the ocean-beach we slept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daughter of the Dawn, we drew our ships</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great deep, and raised the masts and spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sails; the crews, all entering, took their seats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the benches, ranged in order due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beat the foaming water with their oars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again to Egypt’s coast I brought the fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the river that descends from Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there I offered chosen hecatombs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And having thus appeased the gods, I reared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tomb to Agamemnon, that his fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might never die. When this was done I sailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For home; the gods bestowed a favoring wind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now remain thou till the eleventh day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or till the twelfth, beneath my roof, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will I dismiss thee with munificent gifts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three steeds, a polished chariot, and a cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of price, with which to pour, from day to day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine to the gods in memory of me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake discreet Telemachus again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Atrides, seek not to detain me long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I could sit contentedly a year</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside thee, never longing for my home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor for my parents, such delight I find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In listening to thy words; but even now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hallowed Pylos, my companions grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weary, while thou delayest my return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gifts⁠—whate’er thou choosest to bestow⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them be such as I can treasure up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The steeds to Ithaca I may not take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I leave them to adorn thy retinue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou art ruler o’er a realm of plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where grows much lotus, and sweet grasses spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wheat and rye, and the luxuriant stalks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the white barley. But in Ithaca</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are no broad grounds for coursing, meadows none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goats graze amid its fields, a fairer land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than those where horses feed. No isle that lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the deep has either roads for steeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or meadows, least of all has Ithaca.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the valiant Menelaus smiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kindly touched him with his hand and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear son, thou comest of a generous stock;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy words declare it. I will change my gifts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well I may. Of all that in my house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are treasured up, the choicest I will give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the most precious. I will give a cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought all of silver save its brim of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero, King of Sidon, gave it me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I was coming home, and underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His roof was sheltered. Now it shall be thine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So talked they with each other. Meantime came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those who prepared the banquet to the halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great monarch. Bringing sheep they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strengthening wine. Their wives, who on their brows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore showy fillets, brought the bread, and thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the house of Menelaus all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was bustle, setting forth the evening meal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in the well-paved court which lay before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of Ulysses, where of late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their insolence was shown, the suitor train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amused themselves with casting quoits and spears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While by themselves Antinoüs, and the youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of godlike mien, Eurymachus, who both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were eminent above the others, sat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To them Noëmon, son of Phronius, went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew near, bespake Antinoüs and inquired:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Is it among us known, or is it not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Antinoüs, when Telemachus returns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sandy Pylos? Thither he is gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my galley, which I need to cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spacious Elis. There I have twelve mares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hardy mule-colts with them yet untamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some I must subdue to take the yoke.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and they were both amazed; for they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had never thought of him as visiting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neleian Pylos, deeming that the youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was somewhere in his fields, among the flocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or haply with the keeper of the swine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did Antinoüs, Eupeithes’ son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make answer: “Tell me truly when he sailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what young men of Ithaca he chose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To go with him. Were they his slaves, or hired</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be his followers? Tell, for I would know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole. Took he thy ship against thy will?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or didst thou yield it at his first request?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Noëmon, son of Phornius, thus replied:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Most willingly I gave it, for what else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would anyone have done when such a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desired it in his need? It would have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard to deny it. For the band of youths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who followed him, they are the bravest here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all our people; and I saw embark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As their commander, Mentor, or some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like Mentor altogether. One thing moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wonder. Only yesterday, at dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I met with Mentor here, whom I before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had seen embarking for the Pylian coast.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Noëmon spake, and to his father’s house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Departed. Both were troubled at his words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the suitors took at once their seats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ceased their pastimes. Then Antinoüs spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of Eupeithes, greatly vexed; his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was darkened with blind rage; his eyes shot fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strange doings these! a great and proud exploit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Performed⁠—this voyage of Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which we had called impossible! The boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In spite of us, has had his will and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carried off a ship, and for his crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chosen the bravest of the people here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He yet will prove a pest. May Jupiter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crush him ere he can work us further harm!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now give me a swift barque and twenty men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may lie in ambush and keep watch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his return within the straits between</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This isle and rugged Samos; then, I deem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will have sought his father to his cost.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; they praised his words and bade him act,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rose and left their places, entering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of Ulysses. Brief the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That passed before Penelope was warned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of what the suitors treacherously planned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The herald Medon told her all. He heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the outer court their counsels while within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They plotted, and he hastened through the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring the tidings to Penelope.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Penelope perceived him as he stepped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the threshold, and bespake him thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, herald, have the suitor princes sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee hither? comest thou to bid the maids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of great Ulysses leave their tasks and make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A banquet ready? Would their wooing here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And elsewhere were but ended, and this feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were their last feast on earth! Ye who in throngs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come hither and so wastefully consume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The substance of the brave Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have ye not from your parents, while ye yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were children, heard how once Ulysses lived</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among them, never wronging any man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the realm by aught he did or said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As mighty princes often do, through hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some and love of others? Never man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endured injustice at his hands, but you⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your vile designs and acts are known; ye bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No grateful memory of a good man’s deeds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then, in turn, experienced Medon spake:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O queen, I would this evil were the worst!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors meditate a greater still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a more heinous far. May Jupiter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never permit the crime! Their purpose is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To meet Telemachus, on his return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay him with the sword; for thou must know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That on a voyage to the Pylian coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And noble Lacedaemon he has sailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gather tidings of his father’s fate.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and her knees failed her and her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank as she heard. Long time she could not speak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes were filled with tears, and her clear voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was choked; yet, finding words at length, she said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O herald! wherefore should my son have gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no need that he should trust himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the swift ships, those horses of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which men traverse its unmeasured waste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it that he might leave no name on earth?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then again experienced Medon spake:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I know not whether prompted by some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or moved by his own heart thy son has sailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Pylos, hoping there to hear some news</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his returning father, or his fate.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus having said, the herald, traversing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of Ulysses, went his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While a keen anguish overpowered the queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor could she longer bear to keep her place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her seat⁠—and many seats were there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on the threshold of her gorgeous rooms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay piteously lamenting. Round her came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her maidens wailing⁠—all, both old and young,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who formed her household. These Penelope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sobbing in her great sorrow, thus bespake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hear me, my friends, the heavens have cast on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Griefs heavier than on any others born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reared with me⁠—me, who had lost by death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already a most gracious husband, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who bore a lion heart and who was graced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With every virtue, greatly eminent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the Greeks, and widely famed abroad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Hellas and all Argos. Now my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whom I loved, is driven before the storms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From home, inglorious, and I was not told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his departure. Ye too, worthless crew!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye took no thought, not one of you, to call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me from my sleep, although ye must have known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full well when he embarked in his black ship.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if it had been told me that he planned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This voyage, then, impatient as he was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sail, he would have certainly remained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else have left me in these halls a corpse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now let one of my attendants call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged Dolius, whom, when first I came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this abode, my father gave to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be my servant, and who has in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My orchards. Let him haste and take his place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside Laertes, and to him declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that has happened, that he may devise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some fitting remedy, or go among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people, to deplore the dark designs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those who now are plotting to destroy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heir of great Ulysses and his own.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Eurycleia, the beloved nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered: “Dear lady, slay me with the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or leave me here alive; I will conceal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing that has been done or said. I gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that he asked, both bread and delicate wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took a solemn oath, which he required,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tell thee naught of this till twelve days passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or till thou shouldst thyself inquire and hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his departure, that those lovely cheeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might not be stained with tears. Now bathe and put</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh garments on, and to the upper rooms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending, with thy handmaids offer prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pallas, daughter of the god who bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aegis. She will then protect thy son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even from death. Grieve not the aged man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already much afflicted. Sure I am</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lineage of Arcesius has not lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The favor of the gods, but someone yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surviving will possess its lofty halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And its rich acres, stretching far away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake; the queen repressed her grief, and held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes from tears. She took the bath and put</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh garments on, and, to the upper rooms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending with her maidens, heaped with cakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A canister, and prayed to Pallas thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Daughter invincible of Jupiter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Aegis-bearer, hear me. If within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy courts the wise Ulysses ever burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fat thighs of beeves or sheep, remember it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rescue my dear son, and bring to naught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wicked plots of the proud suitor-crew.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake, and wept aloud. The goddess heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her prayer. Meantime the suitors filled with noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadowy palace-halls, and there were some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among that throng of arrogant youths who said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Truly the queen, whom we have wooed so long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prepares for marriage; little does she know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bloody death we destine for her son.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake they, unaware of what was done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elsewhere. Antinoüs then stood forth and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Good friends, I warn you all that ye refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From boasts like these, lest someone should report</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your words within. Now let us silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise up, and all conspire to put in act</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The counsel all so heartily approve.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and chose a crew of twenty men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bravest. To the seaside and the ship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They went, and down to the deep water drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ship, and put the mast and sails on board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fitted duly to their leathern rings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The oars, and spread the white sail overhead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their nimble-handed servants brought them arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they moored the galley, went on board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And supped and waited for the evening star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now in the upper chamber the chaste queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Penelope, lay fasting; food or wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She had not tasted, and her thoughts were still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixed on her blameless son. Would he escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The threatened death, or perish by the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the insolent suitors? As a lion’s thoughts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, midst a crowd of men, he sees with dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hostile circle slowly closing round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such were her thoughts, when balmy sleep at length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came creeping over her as on her couch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lay reclined, her limbs relaxed in rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Pallas framed a new device; she called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A phantom up, in aspect like the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iphthima, whom Eumelus had espoused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Pherae, daughter of the high-souled chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Icarius. Her she sent into the halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of great Ulysses, that she might beguile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sorrowful Penelope from tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lamentations. By the thong that held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bolt she slid into the royal bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And standing by her head bespake the queen:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Penelope, afflicted as thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou asleep? The ever-blessed gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Permit thee not to grieve and weep; thy son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who has not sinned against them, shall return.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then discreet Penelope replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still sweetly slumbering at the Gate of Dreams:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, sister, art thou here, who ne’er before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast come to me? The home is far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which thou dwellest. Thou exhortest me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cease from grieving, and to lay aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The painful thoughts that crowd into my mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And torture me who have already lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A noble-minded, lionhearted spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One eminent among Achaia’s sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every virtue, and whose fame was spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Hellas and through Argos. Now my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My best beloved, goes to sea⁠—a boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unused to hardships, and unskilled to deal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With strangers. More I sorrow for his sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than for his father’s. I am filled with fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tremble lest he suffer wrong from those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among whom he has gone, or on the deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he has enemies who lie in wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slay him ere he reach his home again.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then the shadowy image spake again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be of good courage; let not fear o’ercome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy spirit, for there goes with him a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as all others would desire to have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside them ever, trusting in her power⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pallas Athene, and she looks on thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pity. From her presence I am sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her messenger, declaring this to thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again discreet Penelope replied:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If then thou be a goddess and hast heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A goddess speak these words, declare, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that ill-fated one, if yet he live</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look upon the sun, or else have died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And passed to the abodes beneath the earth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once more the shadowy image spake: “Of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will I say nothing, whether living yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or dead; no time is this for idle words.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She said, and from the chamber glided forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the bolt, and mingled with the winds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then quickly from her couch of sleep arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daughter of Icarius, for her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was glad, so plainly had the dream conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its message in the stillness of the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the suitors on their ocean-path</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went in their galley, plotting cruelly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slay Telemachus. A rocky isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the middle sea, between the coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Ithaca and craggy Samos, lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Named Asteris; of narrow bounds, yet there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sheltered haven is to which two straits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give entrance. There the Achaians lay in wait.</span>
