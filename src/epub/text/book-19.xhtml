				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Removal of the weapons from the hall by Ulysses and his son⁠—Interview of Penelope and Ulysses, who tells her that he has seen her husband in Crete, describes his person and dress, and affirms that within a month he will be in Ithaca⁠—The bath administered to Ulysses by Eurycleia, who recognizes him by a scar on his leg⁠—Narrative of the manner in which the scar was caused.</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Now was the godlike chief Ulysses left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his own palace, planning, with the aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Pallas, to destroy the suitor-train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus bespake his son with winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now is the time, Telemachus, to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weapons that are here, and store them up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the inner rooms. Then, if the suitors ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The reason, answer them with specious words:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say, ‘I have put them where there comes no smoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since even now they do not seem the arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So tarnished are they by the breath of fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet another reason sways my mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prompting of some god, that ye, when flushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wine and in the heat of a dispute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May smite and wound each other, and disgrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banquet and your wooing; for the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of steel doth draw men on to violence.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ended, and Telemachus obeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father’s words, and calling forth his nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged Eurycleia, said to her:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Go, nurse, and see the women all shut up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their own place, while in our inner room</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lay away my father’s beautiful arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neglected long, and sullied by the smoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he was absent. I was then a child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now would keep them from the breath of fire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus the nurse, Dame Eurycleia, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would that at length, my child, thou didst exert</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy proper wisdom here, and take in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy house and thy possessions. But who goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thee to bear a torch, since none of these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy handmaids, are allowed to light thy way?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus discreet Telemachus replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This stranger. No man may be idle here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who eats my bread, though from a distant land.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, nor flew his words in vain. The nurse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed all the portals of that noble pile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses and his glorious son in haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore off the helmets, and the bossy shields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sharp spears, while Pallas held to them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A golden lamp, that shed a fair clear light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to his father spake Telemachus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Father! my eyes behold a marvel. All</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace walls, each beautiful recess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fir-tree beams, the aspiring columns, shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before my eyes, as with a blaze of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some god is surely here, someone of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who make their dwelling in the high broad heaven.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Keep silence; give thy thought no speech, nor ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Concerning aught. Such is the wont of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dwell upon Olympus. Now withdraw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rest upon thy couch, while I remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I would move thy mother and her maids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ask of what concerns me. She, I deem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full sadly will inquire of many things.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; Telemachus departed thence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By torchlight, to his chamber, there to rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he was wont to lie when gentle sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came over him. There lay he down to wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hallowed morning, while Ulysses, left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the palace, meditated still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death to the suitors with Minerva’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sage Penelope now left her bower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like Dian or like golden Venus came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen. Beside the hearth they placed for her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The throne where she was wont to sit, inlaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ivory and silver, which of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The artisan Icmalius wrought. They laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close to the throne a footstool, over which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was spread an ample fleece. On this sat down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sage Penelope. Her white-armed train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of handmaids came with her; they cleared away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The abundant feast, and bore the tables off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cups from which those insolent men had drunk;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They laid upon the ground the lighted brands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heaped fresh fuel round them, both for light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And warmth. And now Melantho once again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bespake Ulysses with unmannerly words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stranger, wilt thou forever be a pest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranging the house at night to play the spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the women? Leave the hall, thou wretch!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gorge thyself without, else wilt thou go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly, driven by blows and flaming brands.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sage Ulysses frowned on her, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pert creature! why so fiercely rail at me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it that I am squalid and ill-clad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forced by want to beg from hand to hand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is the fate of poor and wandering men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I too was opulent once, inhabiting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A plenteous home among my fellow-men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And often gave the wanderer alms, whoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He might be and in whatsoever need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I had many servants, and large store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of things by which men lead a life of ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are called rich. But Jupiter, the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Saturn, put an end to this, for so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It pleased the god. Now, therefore, woman, think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou mayst lose the beauty which is now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy pride among the serving-women here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy mistress may be wroth, and make thy life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hard one; or Ulysses may come back⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is hope of that. Or if it be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he has perished, and returns no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There still remains his son Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who by Apollo’s grace is now a man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no one of the women in these halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May think to misbehave, and yet escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eye, for he no longer is a boy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; Penelope, the prudent, heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, calling to her maid, rebuked her thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O bold and shameless! I have taken note</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy behavior; thou hast done a wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which thy head should answer. Well thou know’st,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou hast heard me say, that I would ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stranger in these halls if aught he knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my Ulysses, for whose sake I grieve.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to the matron of the household turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen, and thus bespake Eurynomè:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Bring now a seat, Eurynomè, and spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fleece upon it, where the stranger guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May sit at ease, and hear what I shall say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answer me, for I have much to ask.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake; the ancient handmaid brought with speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A polished seat, and o’er it spread a fleece.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, much-enduring chief, sat down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus the sage Penelope began:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“First will I ask thee who thou art, and whence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where is thy birthplace, and thy parents who?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O lady, none in all the boundless earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can speak of thee with blame. Thy fame has reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great heavens. It is like the renown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some most excellent king, of godlike sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er many men and mighty, who upholds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Justice in all his realm. The dark-soiled earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings wheat and barley forth; the trees are bowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fruit; the meadows swarm with noble herds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea with fish, and under his wise reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people prosper. Therefore ask, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of other things, while I am underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy palace-roof, but of my race and home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inquire not, lest thou waken in my mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unhappy memories. I am a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sorrow, and it would become me ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sit lamenting in another’s house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shedding tears. Besides, a grief indulged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doth grow in violence. Thy maids would blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou perhaps, and ye would call my tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maudlin tears of one o’ercome with wine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the sage Penelope again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stranger, such grace of feature and of form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As once I had the immortals took away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What time the Argive warriors sailed for Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my Ulysses with them. Could he now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return to rule my household as of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wider and the brighter were my fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now I lead a wretched life, so great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many are the evils which some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaps on me. For the chieftains who bear sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the isles⁠—Dulichium, and the fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Samos, and Zacynthus dark with woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those who rule in sunny Ithaca⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woo me against my will, and waste away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My substance. Therefore have I small regard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For strangers and for suppliants, and the tribe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heralds, servants of the public weal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, pining for Ulysses, wear away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My life. The suitors urge the marriage rite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I with art delay it. Once some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prompted me to begin an ample web,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide and of subtle texture, in my rooms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I said: ‘Youths, who are pressing me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To marriage, since Ulysses is no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urge me no further till I shall complete⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That so the threads may not be spun in vain⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This shroud for old Laertes, when grim fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And death’s long sleep at last shall overtake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero; else among the multitude</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Grecian women I shall bear the blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If one whose ample wealth so well was known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should lie in death without a funeral robe.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I spake, and easily their minds were swayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By what I said, and I began to weave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ample web, but ravelled it again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By torchlight every evening. For three years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I foiled them thus; but when the fourth year came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought its train of hours and changing moons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many days had passed, they came on me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through my maidens’ fault, a careless crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They caught me at my fraud, and chid me sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, though unwilling, I was forced to end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My task, and cannot longer now escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marriage, nor is any refuge left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My parents both exhort me earnestly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To choose a husband, and my son with grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholds the suitors wasting his estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he already is a man and well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can rule his household; Jupiter bestows so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such honor on him. Now, I pray, declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy lineage, for thou surely art not sprung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the old fabulous oak, nor from a rock.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O royal consort of Laertes’ son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou still ask my lineage? I will then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disclose it, but thou wakest in my heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New sorrows. So it ever is with one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who long, like me, is far away from home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering in many realms, and suffering much;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since thou dost require it, thou shalt hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Crete is a region lying in the midst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the black deep, a fair and fruitful land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girt by the waters. Many are the men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, numberless, who make it their abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ninety are its cities. Different tongues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are spoken by the dwellers of the isle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In part they are Achaians, and in part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are Cretans of the soil, a gallant stock;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There dwell Cydonians, Dorians of three tribes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And proud Pelasgians. Their great capital</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is Knossos, where the monarch Minos dwelt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He who at every nine years’ end conferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Jove almighty; and to him was born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deucalion, my brave father, who begat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me and Idomeneus, the King of Crete.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Ilium in his beaked galleys sailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Idomeneus with Atreus’ sons. My name⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A name well known⁠—is Aethon. ’Twas at Crete</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw Ulysses, who received from me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The welcome due a guest. A violent wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had driven him from Maleia and the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That led to Ilium, and had carried him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Crete, and lodged him in the dangerous port</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amnisus, close to Ilithyia’s cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where scarce his fleet escaped the hurricane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence came he to the city, and inquired</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For King Idomeneus, who was, he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His dear and honored guest; but he had sailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ten days before, perhaps eleven, for Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his beaked galleys. To the palace there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I led Ulysses, and with liberal cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Welcomed the chief, for plentifully stored</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The royal dwelling was. I also gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meal from the public magazines to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those who followed him, and dark red wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought from the country round, and beeves to slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sacrifice, that so their hearts might feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No lack of aught. Twelve days the noble Greeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remained with us. A violent north-wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which scarcely suffered them to stand upright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On shore, withstood them. Some unfriendly power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had bid it blow; but on the thirteenth day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its fury ceased, and the fleet put to sea.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus went he on, inventing tales that seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like truth. She listened, melting into tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flowed as when on mountain height the snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shed by the west-wind, feels the east-wind’s breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flows in water, and the hurrying streams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are filled; so did Penelope’s fair cheeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem to dissolve in tears⁠—tears shed for him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sat beside her even then. He saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His weeping wife, and pitied her at heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet were his eyes like iron or like horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moved not in their lids; for artfully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He kept his tears from falling. When the queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had ceased to weep, she answered him and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, stranger, let me prove thee, if in truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst receive, as thou hast just declared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thine abode, my husband and his train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of noble friends. Describe the garb he wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How looked he, and the friends he brought with him?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O lady, hard it is to answer thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long have I been far away from home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis now the twentieth year since he was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left the isle, but, as my memory bids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So will I speak. A fleecy purple cloak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses wore, a double web; the clasp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was golden, with two fastenings, and in front</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It showed a work of rare design⁠—a hound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That held in his forepaws a spotted fawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struggling before his open mouth. Although</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The figures were of gold, we all admired</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hound intent to break his victim’s neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fawn that, writhing, plied her nimble feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To free herself. Around the hero’s chest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waist I saw a lustrous tunic worn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soft, like the thin film of the onion dried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bright as sunshine; many ladies looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wonder on it. Yet consider this;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not whether thus attired he left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His home, or whether, in the voyage thence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some comrade gave the garments, or perhaps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some friendly host, for he was very dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To many; among the Greeks were few like him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I gave him, from myself, a brazen sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a fair purple cloak, a double web,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides a tunic reaching to his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with due honors sent him on his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his good ship. There came and went with him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A herald somewhat older than himself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me portray him⁠—hunchbacked, swarthy skinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And curly haired, Eurybates his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses honored him above the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his companions, for they thought alike.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ceased; the queen was moved to deeper grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she remembered all the tokens well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which he spake; and when that passionate gust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of weeping ceased, she spake again and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stranger, till now thy presence in these halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has only moved my pity; thou henceforth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art dear and honored. It was I who gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The garments thou hast told me of; these hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folded them in my chamber. I put on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glittering clasp to be his ornament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now I never shall behold him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Returning to his own dear land and home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So cruel was the fate that took him hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Ilium, in his roomy ship, a town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of evil omen never to be named.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let not thy grief for him whom thou hast lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wither thy beauty longer, and consume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy heart. And yet I blame thee not at all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any wife in losing him to whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gave herself while yet a maid, and bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children, will mourn him, though he be in worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Below Ulysses, who, as fame declares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is like the gods. But cease to grieve, and hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I shall say, and I shall speak the truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor will I hide from thee that I have heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lately from Ulysses, yet alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And journeying homeward, in the opulent realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Thesprotians, whence he brings with him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much and rare treasure, gathered there among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people. His beloved friends he lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his good ship; the black deep swallowed them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In coming from Trinacria, for his crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had slaughtered there the oxen of the Sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Sun and Jove were angry; therefore all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His comrades perished in the billowy sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But him upon his galley’s keel the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove to the coast where the Phaeacians dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kinsmen of the gods. They welcomed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And honored him as if he were a god,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave him many things, and would have sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero safely to his native isle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here Ulysses would have been long since,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that he deemed it wise to travel far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gather wealth⁠—for well Ulysses knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all other men, the arts of gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none in these could think to rival him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who also, in his palace, swore to me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As to the gods of heaven he poured the wine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That even then a galley was drawn down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the water, and already manned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rowers, who should take Ulysses home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But me he first dismissed, for at the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A barque of the Thesprotians left the port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound for Dulichium’s cornfields. Ere I went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He showed the treasures of Ulysses stored</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the king’s palace⁠—treasures that might serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feed the household of another chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the tenth generation. He who owned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wealth was at Dodona, so the king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Declared, inquiring, at the lofty oak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Jupiter, the counsel of the god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to return to his dear native land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long a wanderer⁠—whether openly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else by stealth. So he is safe, and soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will he be nearer to us; for not long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can he remain away from all his friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fatherland. To this I plight my oath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Jove, the greatest and the best of gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be witness, and this hearth of the good prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, where I sit, that every word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which I have said to thee will be fulfilled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the year Ulysses will return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As this month passes and the next comes in.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the sage Penelope again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would that it might be thus, O stranger guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou hast said; then shouldst thou have such thanks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bounty at my hands that everyone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who meets thee should rejoice with thee. And yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thought abides with me, and so indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It must be, that Ulysses will no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return, nor wilt thou find an escort hence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now no master like Ulysses rules⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what a man was he!⁠—within these walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To welcome or dismiss the honored guest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now, ye maidens, let the stranger bathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spread his couch with blankets, fleecy cloaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showy tapestries, that he may lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm till the Morning, in her golden car,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draw near; then with the early morn again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bathe and anoint him, that he may sit down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside Telemachus prepared to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His morning meal. Ill shall he fare who dares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Molest the stranger; he shall have no place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or office here, however he may rage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how, O stranger, wouldst thou learn that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mind and thoughtful wisdom am above</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All other women, if I let thee sit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Squalid and meanly clad at banquets here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Short is the life of man, and whoso bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cruel heart, devising cruel things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On him men call down evil from the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While living, and pursue him, when he dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With scoffs. But whoso is of generous heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And harbors generous aims, his guests proclaim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His praises far and wide to all mankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And numberless are they who call him good.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such cloaks and splendid coverings please me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since in my long-oared barque I left behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snowy peaks of Crete. I still will lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I am wont through many a sleepless night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a mean couch to wait the holy Morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her car of gold. I do not like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This washing of the feet. No maiden here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ministers to thee may touch my foot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if among them be some aged dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faithful, who has suffered in her life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I have suffered, she may touch my feet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus the sage Penelope rejoined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dear guest⁠—for never to these halls has come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stranger so discreet or better liked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By me, so wisely thou dost speak, and well⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have an aged prudent dame, whose care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reared my unfortunate husband. She received</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nursling when his mother brought him forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she, though small her strength, will wash thy feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise, prudent Eurycleia, thou shalt wash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feet of one whose years must be the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thy own master’s; such is doubtless now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, with such wrinkled feet and hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For quickly doth misfortune make men old.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake; the aged handmaid hid her face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With both her hands, and, shedding bitter tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus sorrowfully to the queen replied:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My heart is sad for thee, my son; and yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can do nothing. Can it be that Jove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hates thee beyond all other? though thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So reverent to the gods? No man on earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has burned so many thighs of fatling beasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chosen hecatombs as thou to Jove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Thunderer, with prayer that thou mayst reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A calm old age, and rear thy glorious son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To manhood; yet the god hath cut thee off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy return forever. Even now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance the women of some princely house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he has entered in some distant land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scoff at him as these wretched creatures scoff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At thee, O stranger, who, to shun their taunts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And insults, wilt not suffer them to wash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy feet. The sage Penelope commands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I am not unwilling. I will wash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy feet, both for her sake and for thy own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For deeply am I moved at sight of thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear what I say: of strangers in distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come many hither, yet have I beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one who bears, in shape and voice and feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such likeness to our absent lord as thou.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O aged woman, so has it been said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all who have beheld both him and me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They all declare that we are very like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each other; thou in this hast spoken well.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; she took a shining vase designed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For washing feet, and poured cold water in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In large abundance, and warm water next.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, who had sat before the hearth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved to a darker spot, for in his mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thought arose that she might find a scar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his limbs in handling them, and thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His secret would be known. She came and bathed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His feet, and found the scar. ’Twas where a boar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his white tooth had gashed the limb, as once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He journeyed to Parnassus, where he paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A visit to Autolycus and his sons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mother’s noble father, who excelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All men in craft and oaths, such was the gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conferred on him by Hermes; for to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Autolycus made grateful offerings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thighs of lambs and kids, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The god was with him. Once Autolycus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to the opulent realm of Ithaca,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found his daughter with a son new born;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There Eurycleia placed upon his knees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The infant, just as he had supped, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Give this dear babe, Autolycus, a name⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy daughter’s son, vouchsafed to many prayers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus Autolycus in answer spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Daughter and son-in-law, be his the name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I shall give. In coming to his isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bear the hate of many⁠—both of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And women⁠—scattered o’er the nourishing earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name him Ulysses therefore, and when, grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To man’s estate, he visits the proud halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reared at Parnassus, where his mother dwelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my possessions lie, I will bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A share on him, and send him home rejoiced.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And therefore went Ulysses to receive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The promised princely gifts. Autolycus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his sons received him with kind words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And friendly grasp of hands. Amphithea there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mother’s mother⁠—took him in her arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed his brow and both his beautiful eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to his noble sons Autolycus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called to prepare a feast, and they obeyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They brought and slew a steer of five years old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flayed and dressed it, hewed the joints apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sliced the flesh, and fixed it upon spits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roasted it carefully, and gave to each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His part. So all the day till set of sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They feasted, to the full content of all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the sun had set, and earth grew dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They laid them down, and took the gift of sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born of the Dawn, forth issued the young men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children of Autolycus, with hounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hunt, attended by their noble guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses. Up the steeps of that high mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parnassus, clothed with woods, they climbed, and soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were on its airy heights. The sun, new risen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the deep ocean’s gently flowing stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now smote the fields. The hunters reached a dell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hounds before them tracked the game; behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed the children of Autolycus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The generous youth Ulysses, brandishing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spear of mighty length, came pressing on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close to the hounds. There lay a huge wild boar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within a thicket, where moist-blowing winds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came not, nor in his brightness could the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce with his beams the covert, nor the rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pelt through, so closely grew the shrubs. The ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was heaped with sheddings of the withered leaves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him came the noise of dogs and men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approaching swiftly. From his lair he sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faced them, with the bristles on his neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upright, and flashing eyes. Ulysses rushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the others, with the ponderous spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised high in his strong hand intent to smite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boar was first to strike; he dealt a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sidelong, and gashed his foe above the knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tore the flesh, but left untouched the bone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, striking with his burnished spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boar’s right shoulder, drove the weapon through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell with piercing cries amid the dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the life left him. Then around their guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kindly children of Autolycus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came and bound up with care the wound, and stanched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With spells the dark blood of the blameless youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hastened with him to their father’s home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when Autolycus and they his sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had seen him wholly healed, they loaded him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With presents, and, rejoicing for his sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent him rejoicing back to Ithaca.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father and his gracious mother there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoiced in turn, and asked him of the scar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how it came, and he related all⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How by the white tusk of a savage boar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wound was given on the Parnassian heights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he was hunting with her father’s sons.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The aged woman, as she took the foot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into her hands, perceived by touch the scar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, letting fall the limb, it struck the vase.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loud rang the brass, the vase was overturned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poured the water forth. At once a rush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gladness and of grief came o’er her heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears filled her eyes, and her clear voice was choked.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She touched Ulysses on the chin, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear child! thou art Ulysses, of a truth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I knew thee not till I had touched the scar.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So speaking, toward Penelope she turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes, about to tell her that her lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in the palace; but the queen saw not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that passed was unperceived by her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Pallas turned her thoughts another way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meantime, Ulysses on the nurse’s throat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid his right hand, and with the other drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged woman nearer him, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nurse, wouldst thou ruin me, who drew long since</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milk from thy bosom, and who now return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After much suffering borne for twenty years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mine own land? Now then, since thou hast learned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truth⁠—by prompting of some god, no doubt⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep silence, lest some others in the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should learn it also. Else⁠—I tell thee this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will perform my word⁠—if God permit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I o’ercome the arrogant suitor-crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nurse as thou art, I spare not even thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in these halls the other maidens die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then thus the prudent Eurycleia said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What words, my son, have passed thy lips? for well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest my firm mind; it never yields.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like solid rock or steel I keep my trust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This let me tell thee, and, I pray thee, keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My words in mind. If, by the aid of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou overcome the arrogant suitor-crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I name the handmaids that disgrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy household, and point out the innocent.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, thus rejoined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why name them, nurse? It needs not. I myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall watch them, and shall know them all. Hold thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy peace, and leave the issue with the gods.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the aged woman left the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring a second bath, for on the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first was spilled. When she had bathed his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made them smooth with oil, Ulysses drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close to the hearth his seat again, to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warmth, and with his tatters hid the scar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus the sage Penelope began:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stranger, but little longer will I yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inquire; the hour of grateful rest is near</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those who, though unhappy, can receive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The balm of slumber. Yet for me some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appoints immeasurable grief. All day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sorrows and in sighs, my solace is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To oversee my maidens at their tasks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the palace; but when evening comes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all betake themselves to rest, I lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my couch, and sorrows thick and sharp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awake new misery in my heart. As when,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fresh spring, the swarthy Nightingale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter of Pandarus, among thick leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings sweetly to the woods, and, changing oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strain, pours forth her voice of many notes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lamenting the beloved Itylus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her son by royal Zethos, whom she smote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwittingly, and slew; with such quick change</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mind is tossed from thought to thought. I muse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether to keep my place beside my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hold what here is mine, my dower, my maids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And high-roofed halls, as one who still reveres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her husband’s bed, and heeds the public voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or follow one of the Achaian chiefs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noblest of the wooers, and the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who offers marriage presents without stint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My son’s green years, while he was yet a boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unripe in mind, allowed me not to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leave his father’s home; but he is grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the verge of manhood. He desires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I should leave the palace, for his wrath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is great against the men who waste his wealth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear, and interpret now a dream of mine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within these courts are twenty geese that eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corn from the water, and I look on them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleased and amused. From off a mountain came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hook-beaked eagle, broke their necks, and left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bodies strewn about the palace dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soared again into the air of heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wept and moaned, although it was a dream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round me came the fair-haired Grecian maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lamenting wildly that the bird of prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had slain my geese. Then came the eagle back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took his perch upon the jutting roof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus bespake me in a human voice:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O daughter of Icarius, the renowned!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let not thy heart be troubled; this is not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dream, but a true vision, and will be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfilled. The geese denote the suitor-train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, who was an eagle once, am come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy husband, now to end them utterly.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He spake; my slumbers left me, and I looked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw the geese that in the palace still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were at their trough, and feeding as before.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus Ulysses, the sagacious, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lady, the dream that visited thy sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot be wrested to another sense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses has himself revealed to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The way of its fulfillment. Death is near</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors, and not one escapes his doom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the sage Penelope again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of dreams, O stranger, some are meaningless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And idle, and can never be fulfilled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two portals are there for their shadowy shapes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ivory one, and one of horn. The dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That come through the carved ivory deceive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With promises that never are made good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But those which pass the doors of polished horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are beheld of men, are ever true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I cannot hope that my strange dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came through them, though my son and I would both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoice if it were so. This let me say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heed me well. Tomorrow brings to us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hateful morn which takes me from my home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of Ulysses. I shall now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Propose a contest. In the palace court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses in a row set up twelve stakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like props that hold a galley up; each stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had its own ring; he stood afar, and sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An arrow through them all. I shall propose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This contest to the suitors. He who bends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bow with easy mastery, and sends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the twelve rings an arrow, I will take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow from the palace where I passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My youthful married life⁠—a beautiful home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stored with wealth; a home which I shall long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember, even in my nightly dreams.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let not this contest be delayed; the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ready wiles, Ulysses, will be here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere, tampering with the hero’s polished bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors shall prevail to stretch the cord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And send an arrow through the rings of steel.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus the sage Penelope rejoined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stranger, if, sitting in the palace here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou still wouldst entertain me as thou dost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleep would not fall upon my lids; and yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleepless the race of mortals cannot be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So have the gods ordained, who measure out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lot to man upon the nourishing earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I to the upper rooms withdraw, to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My place upon the couch which has become</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me a place of sorrow and of tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since my Ulysses went away to Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fatal town which should be named no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will lay me down; but thou remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within these walls, and make the floor thy bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or let these maidens spread a couch for thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Penelope, thus having spoken, went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up to her royal bower, but not alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her maids went with her. When they were within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wept for her dear husband, till at length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blue-eyed Pallas graciously distilled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her closing lids the balm of sleep.</span>
