			<p>
				<span>Tell me, O Muse, of that sagacious man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, having overthrown the sacred town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Ilium, wandered far and visited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The capitals of many nations, learned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The customs of their dwellers, and endured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great suffering on the deep: his life was oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peril, as he labored to bring back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His comrades to their homes. He saved them not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though earnestly he strove; they perished all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through their own folly; for they banqueted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Madmen! upon the oxen of the Sun⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The all-o’erlooking Sun, who cut them off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their return. O goddess, virgin-child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Jove, relate some part of this to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now all the rest, as many as escaped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cruel doom of death, were at their homes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe from the perils of the war and sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While him alone, who pined to see his home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wife again, Calypso, queenly nymph,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great among goddesses, detained within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her spacious grot, in hope that he might yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Become her husband. Even when the years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought round the time in which the gods decreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he should reach again his dwelling-place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ithaca, though he was with his friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His toils were not yet ended. Of the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All pitied him save Neptune, who pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wrath implacable the godlike chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, even to his native land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Among the Ethiopians was the god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off⁠—the Ethiopians most remote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of men. Two tribes there are; one dwells beneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rising, one beneath the setting sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He went to grace a hecatomb of beeves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lambs, and sat delighted at the feast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in the palace of Olympian Jove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other gods assembled, and to them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father of immortals and of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was speaking. To his mind arose the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that Aegisthus whom the famous son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Agamemnon, Prince Orestes, slew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him he thought and thus bespake the gods:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How strange it is that mortals blame the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say that we inflict the ills they bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they, by their own folly and against</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The will of fate, bring sorrow on themselves!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As late Aegisthus, unconstrained by fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Married the queen of Atreus’ son and slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The husband just returned from war. Yet well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knew the bitter penalty, for we</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warned him. We sent the herald Argicide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bidding him neither slay the chief nor woo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His queen, for that Orestes, when he came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To manhood and might claim his heritage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would take due vengeance for Atrides slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Hermes said; his prudent words moved not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The purpose of Aegisthus who now pays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forfeit of his many crimes at once.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, thus replied:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O father, son of Saturn, king of kings!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well he deserved his death. So perish all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guilty of deeds like his! But I am grieved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sage Ulysses, that most wretched man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long detained, repining, and afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From those he loves, upon a distant isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girt by the waters of the central deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A forest isle, where dwells a deity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daughter of wise Atlas, him who knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ocean to its utmost depths, and holds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upright the lofty columns which divide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth from heaven. The daughter there detains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The unhappy chieftain, and with flattering words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would win him to forget his Ithaca.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile, impatient to behold the smokes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rise from hearths in his own land, he pines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And willingly would die. Is not thy heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Olympics, touched by this? And did he not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pay grateful sacrifice to thee beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Argive fleet in the broad realm of Troy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why then, O Jove, art thou so wroth with him?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered cloud-compelling Jove: “My child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What words have passed thy lips? Can I forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Godlike Ulysses, who in gifts of mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Excels all other men, and who has brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Large offerings to the gods that dwell in heaven?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet he who holds the earth in his embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neptune, pursues him with perpetual hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because of Polypheme, the Cyclops, strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all others of his giant race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose eye Ulysses had put out. The nymph</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thoosa brought him forth⁠—a daughter she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Phorcys, ruling in the barren deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the covert of o’erhanging rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She met with Neptune. For this cause the god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shakes the shores, although he slay him not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sends forth Ulysses wandering far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his own country. Let us now consult</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together and provide for his return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Neptune will lay by his wrath, for vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It were for one like him to strive alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the might of all the immortal gods.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then the blue-eyed Pallas spake again:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O father! son of Saturn, king of kings!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If such the pleasure of the blessed gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That now the wise Ulysses shall return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his own land, let us at once despatch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hermes, the Argicide, our messenger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to Ogygia, to the bright-haired nymph,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make our steadfast purpose known to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sufferer Ulysses to his home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will haste to Ithaca, and move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His son, that with a resolute heart he call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long-haired Greeks together and forbid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The excesses of the suitor train, who slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His flocks and slow-paced beeves with crooked horns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Sparta I will send him and the sands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Pylos, to inquire for the return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his dear father. So a glorious fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall gather round him in the eyes of men.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake, and fastened underneath her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair, ambrosial golden sandals worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear her over ocean like the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the boundless land. In hand she took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well tipped with trenchant brass, the mighty spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy and huge and strong, with which she bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole phalanxes of heroes to the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she, the daughter of a mighty sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is angered. From the Olympian heights she plunged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood among the men of Ithaca,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just at the porch and threshold of their chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses. In her hand she bore the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seemed the stranger Mentes, he who led</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Taphians. There before the gate she found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The haughty suitors. Some beguiled the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With draughts, while sitting on the hides of beeves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which they had slaughtered. Heralds were with them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And busy menials: some who in the bowls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tempered the wine with water, some who cleansed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tables with light sponges, and who set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banquet forth and carved the meats for all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Telemachus the godlike was the first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see the goddess as he sat among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crowd of suitors, sad at heart, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his illustrious father, who might come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scatter those who filled his palace halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And win new honor, and regain the rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over his own. As thus he sat and mused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the suitors, he beheld where stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pallas, and forth he sprang; he could not bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep a stranger waiting at his door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He came, and taking her right hand received</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brazen spear, and spake these winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hail, stranger! thou art truly welcome here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First come and share our feast and be refreshed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then say what thou requirest at our hands.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake and led the way, and in his steps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pallas Athenè followed. Entering then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lofty halls, he set the spear upright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a tall column, in the armory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With polished walls, where rested many a lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the large-souled Ulysses. Then he placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His guest upon a throne, o’er which he spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A covering many-hued and beautiful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave her feet a footstool. Near to her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drew his party-colored seat, aloof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From where the suitors sat; that so his guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might not amid those haughty revellers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be wearied with the tumult and enjoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His meal the less, and that himself might ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>News of his absent father. In a bowl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of silver, from a shapely ewer of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A maid poured water for the hands, and set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A polished table near them. Then approached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A venerable matron bringing bread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And delicacies gathered from the board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he who served the feast before them placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chargers with various meats, and cups of gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While round the board a herald moved, and poured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine for the guests. The haughty suitors now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came in, and took their places on the thrones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And couches; heralds poured upon their hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The water; maidens heaped the canisters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bread, and all put forth their hands to share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banquet on the board, while to the brim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boys filled the beakers. When the calls of thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hunger were appeased, the suitors thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of other things that well become a feast⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Song and the dance. And then a herald brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shapely harp, and gave it to the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Phemius, who had only by constraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sung to the suitors. On the chords he struck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A prelude to his lay, while, as he played,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus, that others might not hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaned forward, and to blue-eyed Pallas spake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My friend and guest, wilt thou take no offence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At what I say? These revellers enjoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The harp and song, for at no cost of theirs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They waste the substance of another man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose white bones now are mouldering in the rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon some mainland, or are tossed about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By ocean billows. Should they see him once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ithaca, their prayers would rather rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For swifter feet than richer stores of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raiment. But an evil fate is his,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he has perished. Even should we hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From any of the dwellers upon earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he is near at hand, we could not hope.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For him is no return. But now, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, and frankly tell me, who thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of what race of men, and where thy home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who thy parents; how the mariners</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought thee to Ithaca, and who they claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be, for well I deem thou couldst not come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither on foot. All this, I pray, relate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truly, that I may know the whole. Art thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the first time arrived, or hast thou been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father’s guest? for many a stranger once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resorted to our palace, and he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The way to win the kind regard of men.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, answered thus:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will tell all and truly. I am named</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mentes; my father was the great in war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anchialus. I rule a people skilled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wield the oar, the Taphians, and I come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ship and crew across the dark blue deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Temesè, and to a race whose speech</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is different from my own, in quest of brass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bringing bright steel with me. I have left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moored at the field behind the town my barque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the bay of Reithrus, and beneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woods of Neius. We claim to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guests by descent, and from our fathers’ time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou wilt learn if thou shouldst meet and ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laertes, the old hero. It is said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He comes no more within the city walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the fields dwells sadly by himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where an old handmaid sets upon his board</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His food and drink when weariness unnerves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His limbs in creeping o’er the fertile soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his rich vineyard. I am come because</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard thy father had at last returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now am certain that the gods delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His journey hither; for the illustrious man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot have died, but is detained alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Somewhere upon the ocean, in some spot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girt by the waters. There do cruel men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And savage keep him, pining to depart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now let me speak of what the gods reveal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what I deem will surely come to pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although I am no seer and have no skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In omens drawn from birds. Not long the chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will be an exile from his own dear land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though fettered to his place by links of steel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he has large invention, and will plan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A way for his escape. Now tell me this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truly; tall in stature as thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou in fact Ulysses’ son? In face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glorious eyes thou dost resemble him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exceedingly; for he and I of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were oftentimes companions, ere he sailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Ilium, whither also went the best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the Argives in their roomy ships,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor have we seen each other since that day.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Telemachus, the prudent, spake: “O guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True answer shalt thou have. My mother says</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am his son; I know not; never man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew his own father. Would I were the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one whose happier lot it was to meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amidst his own estates the approach of age.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the most wretched of the sons of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is he to whom they say I owe my birth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus is thy question answered.” Then again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake blue-eyed Pallas: “Of a truth, the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ordain not that thy race, in years to come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should be inglorious, since Penelope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath borne thee such as I behold thee now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But frankly answer me⁠—what feast is here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what is this assembly? What may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The occasion? is a banquet given? is this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wedding? A collation, where the guests</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furnish the meats, I think it cannot be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So riotously goes the revel on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throughout the palace. A well-judging man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he should come among them, would be moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With anger at the shameful things they do.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again Telemachus, the prudent, spake:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since thou dost ask me, stranger, know that once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich and illustrious might this house be called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While yet the chief was here. But now the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have grown unkind and willed it otherwise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They make his fate a mystery beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fate of other men. I should not grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So deeply for his loss if he had fallen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his companions on the field of Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or midst his kindred when the war was o’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then all the Greeks had built his monument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he had left his son a heritage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glory. Now has he become the prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Harpies, perishing ingloriously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unseen, his fate unheard of, and has left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mourning and grief, my portion. Not for him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone I grieve; the gods have cast on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet other hardships. All the chiefs who rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The isles, Dulichium, Samos, and the groves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shade Zacynthus, and who bear the sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rugged Ithaca, have come to woo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother, and from day to day consume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My substance. She rejects not utterly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their hateful suit, and yet she cannot bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To end it by a marriage. Thus they waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My heritage, and soon will seek my life.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again in grief and anger Pallas spake:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, greatly dost thou need the absent chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses here, that he might lay his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon these shameless suitors. Were he now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To come and stand before the palace gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With helm and buckler and two spears, as first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw him in our house, when drinking wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feasting, just returned from Ephyrè</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Ilus dwelt, the son of Mermerus⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thither went Ulysses in a barque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek a deadly drug with which to taint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brazen arrows; Ilus gave it not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He feared the immortal gods; my father gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The poison, for exceedingly he loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His guest⁠—could now Ulysses, in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once meet the suitors, short would be their lives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitter would the marriage banquet be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet whether he return or not to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vengeance, in his own palace, on this crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wassailers, rests only with the gods.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now let me counsel thee to think betimes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How thou shalt thrust them from thy palace gates.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Observe me, and attend to what I say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tomorrow thou shalt call the Achaian chiefs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To an assembly; speak before them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be the gods thy witnesses. Command</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors all to separate for their homes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if thy mother’s mind be bent to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her return to where her father dwells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mighty prince, and there they will appoint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magnificent nuptials, and an ample dower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as should honor a beloved child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now, if thou wilt heed me, I will give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A counsel for thy good. Man thy best ship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With twenty rowers, and go forth to seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>News of thy absent father. Thou shalt hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply of him from someone of the sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of men, or else some word of rumor sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Jove, revealing what mankind should know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First shape thy course for Pylos, and inquire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of noble Nestor; then, at Sparta, ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fair-haired Menelaus, for he came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last of the mailed Achaians to his home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouldst thou learn that yet thy father lives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will return, have patience yet a year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However hard it seem. But shouldst thou find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he is now no more, return forthwith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy own native land, and pile on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His monument, and let the funeral rites</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be sumptuously performed as may become</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dead, and let thy mother wed again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when all this is fully brought to pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take counsel with thy spirit and thy heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to destroy the suitor crew that haunt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy palace, whether by a secret snare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or open force. No longer shouldst thou act</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if thou wert a boy; thou hast outgrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The age of childish sports. Hast thou not heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What honor the divine Orestes gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all men, when he slew the murderer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crafty wretch Aegisthus, by whose hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The illustrious father of Orestes died?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, my friend⁠—for I perceive that thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art of a manly and a stately growth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be also bold, that men hereafter born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May give thee praise. And now must I depart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my good ship, and to my friends who wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too anxiously perhaps, for my return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Act wisely now, and bear my words in mind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The prudent youth Telemachus rejoined:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well hast thou spoken, and with kind intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O stranger! like a father to a son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ne’er shall I forget what thou hast said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet stay, I pray thee, though in haste, and bathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be refreshed, and take to thy good ship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some gift with thee, such as may please thee well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Precious and rare, which thou mayst ever keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In memory of me⁠—a gift like those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which friendly hosts bestow upon their guests.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the blue-eyed Pallas: “Stay me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now would I depart. Whatever gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy heart may prompt thee to bestow, reserve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I come back, that I may bear it home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou shalt take some precious thing in turn.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the blue-eyed Pallas, and withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending like a bird. She filled his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With strength and courage, waking vividly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father’s memory. Then the noble youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went forth among the suitors. Silent all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sat and listened to the illustrious bard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sang of the calamitous return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Greek host from Troy, at the command</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Pallas. From her chamber o’er the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daughter of Icarius, the sage queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Penelope, had heard the heavenly strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew its theme. Down by the lofty stairs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She came, but not alone; there followed her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two maidens. When the glorious lady reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The threshold of the strong-built hall, where sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors, holding up a delicate veil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her face, and with a gush of tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen bespake the sacred minstrel thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Phemius! thou knowest many a pleasing theme⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deeds of gods and heroes, such as bards</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are wont to celebrate. Take then thy place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sing of one of these, and let the guests</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence drink the wine; but cease this strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is too sad; it cuts me to the heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wakes a sorrow without bounds⁠—such grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bear for him, my lord, of whom I think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Continually; whose glory is abroad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Hellas and through Argos, everywhere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then Telemachus, the prudent, spake:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why, O my mother! canst thou not endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thus the well-graced poet should delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hearers with a theme to which his mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is inly moved? The bards deserve no blame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jove is the cause, for he at will inspires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lay that each must sing. Reprove not, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The minstrel who relates the unhappy fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Greek warriors. All men most applaud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The song that has the newest theme; and thou⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strengthen thy heart to hear it. Keep in mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That not alone Ulysses is cut off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his return, but that with him at Troy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have many others perished. Now withdraw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into thy chamber; ply thy household tasks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loom, the spindle; bid thy maidens speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their work. To say what words beseem a feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belongs to man, and most to me; for here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within these walls the authority is mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The matron, wondering at his words, withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her own place, but in her heart laid up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her son’s wise sayings. When she now had reached,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her attendant maids, the upper rooms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She mourned Ulysses, her beloved spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wept, till blue-eyed Pallas closed her lids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In gentle slumbers. Noisily, meanwhile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors revelled in the shadowy halls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus Telemachus, the prudent, spake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye suitors of my mother, insolent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overbearing; cheerful be our feast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not riotous. It would become us well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To listen to the lay of such a bard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like the gods in voice. I bid you all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meet in full council with the morrow morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may give you warning to depart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From out my palace, and to seek your feasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elsewhere at your own charge⁠—haply to hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your daily banquets at each other’s homes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if it seem to you the better way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plunder one man’s goods, go on to waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My substance; I will call the immortal gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid me, and if Jupiter allow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fit retribution for your deeds, ye die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within this very palace, unavenged.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the suitors bit their close-pressed lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Astonished at the youth’s courageous words.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus Antinoüs, Eupeithes’ son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer: “Most assuredly the gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus, have taught thee how to frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grand sentences and gallantly harangue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne’er may the son of Saturn make thee king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the seagirt Ithaca, whose isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is thy inheritance by claim of birth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Telemachus, the prudent, thus rejoined:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wilt thou be angry at the word I speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Antinoüs? I would willingly accept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kingly station if conferred by Jove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou indeed regard it as the worst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all conditions of mankind? Not so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For him who reigns; his house grows opulent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he the more is honored. Many kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the bounds of seagirt Ithaca</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are, both young and old, let anyone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear rule, since great Ulysses is no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I will be the lord of mine own house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er my servants whom the godlike chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, brought from war, his share of spoil.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Addressed the youth in turn: “Assuredly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What man hereafter, of the Achaian race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall bear the rule o’er seagirt Ithaca</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rests with the gods. But thou shalt keep thy wealth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may no son of violence come to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spoil of thy possessions while men dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ithaca. And now, my friend, I ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who was thy guest; whence came he, of what land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claims he to be, where do his kindred dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where his patrimonial acres lie?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tidings of thy father’s near return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came he, or to receive a debt? How swift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was his departure, waiting not for us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To know him! yet in aspect and in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed to be no man of vulgar note.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Telemachus, the prudent, answered thus:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My father’s coming, O Eurymachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is to be hoped no more; nor can I trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tidings from whatsoever part they come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor pay regard to oracles, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother send to bring a soothsayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the palace, and inquire of him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this man was my father’s guest; he comes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Taphos; Mentes is his name, a son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the brave chief Anchialus; he reigns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the Taphians, men who love the sea.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, but in his secret heart he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The immortal goddess. Then the suitors turned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delighted, to the dance and cheerful song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waited for the evening. On their sports</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The evening with its shadowy blackness came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then each to his own home withdrew to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While to his lofty chamber, in full view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built high in that magnificent palace home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus went up, and sought his couch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intent on many thoughts. The chaste and sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dame Eurycleia by his side went up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lighted torches⁠—she a child of Ops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pisenor’s son. Her, in her early bloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laertes purchased for a hundred beeves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his palace honored equally</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his chaste wife; yet never sought her bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would not wrong his queen. ’Twas she who bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The torches with Telemachus. She loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her young lord more than all the other maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she had nursed him in his tender years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He opened now the chamber door and sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the couch, put his soft tunic off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And placed it in the prudent matron’s hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She folded it and smoothed it, hung it near</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To that fair bed, and, going quickly forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulled at the silver ring to close the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drew the thong that moved the fastening bolt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, lapped in the soft fleeces, all night long.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought of the voyage Pallas had ordained.</span>
